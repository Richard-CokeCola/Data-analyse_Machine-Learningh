Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) has been successfully used for analysing cell biology and oﬀering label-free extraction of biochemical information. Cancer diagnosis based on FTIR spectral data has the potential to revolutionise current cancer diagnosis methods because of its time-saving, low cost and non-destructive results. However, despite the advantages FTIR oﬀers, there are many challenges that stopped the implementation of this technology in clinical application. One major diﬃculty has been reaching a consensus about the choice of parameters of pre-processing and classiﬁcation models. In this paper a series of experiments is described, which aim was to ﬁnd the most suitable pre-processing methods and classiﬁers that avoid underﬁtting and overﬁtting. This paper obtained high sensitivity and speciﬁcity and low misclassiﬁcation rates.
